About Shift It
--------------

This application will let you resize and move your windows without having to using a mouse. Following are some of things you can do with the Shift It:

- Shift the focused window to left/right/top/bottom half of the screen.
- Resize the focused window to fill the whole screen.
- Move the focused window to the center of the screen. 

Shift It is a great tool that lets you organize your windows. Now you can read documents side-by-side without having the pain of manually resizing the windows.
